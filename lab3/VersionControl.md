# Version Control Systems

## Definition and Purpose

**Version control systems** are tools used to track changes made to files over time. They allow you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more

## Benefits and Advantages

In a collaborative environment, version control systems provide several benefits. 
- Allow multiple people to work on a project without overwriting each other's changes.
- Provide a history of changes for review or reverting.
- Aid in solving conflicts when the same parts of a file are edited simultaneously.

## Types of Version Control Systems

There are two main types of version control systems:

1. **Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCS)**: These systems, like SVN, have a single, central repository of files. Users can checkout files, but they don't have a full copy of the project on their local machine.

2. **Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCS)**: These systems, like Git and Mercurial, mirror the repository across multiple locations. Each user has a full copy of the project on their local machine.

In addition  **Local Version Control Systems**: This type of VCS stores all the files and changes on the user local machine.
## Comparison of Popular Version Control Systems

1. **Git**: A distributed version control system. It's known for its speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows.	<!-- ![image](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-100000?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)  ![image](	https://img.shields.io/badge/GitLab-330F63?style=for-the-badge&logo=gitlab&logoColor=white) -->
2. **Subversion (SVN)**: A centralized version control system. It's known for its dependency tracking across directories, named branches, and atomic commits.
3. **Mercurial**: A distributed version control system like Git, but with an easier to use interface. It's known for its performance, scalability, and advanced branching and merging capabilities.


In summary, **Git** is an excellent choice for large projects with multiple contributors, while **SVN** is suitable for small teams working on a single project. **Mercurial** is a more beginner-friendly option with a focus on safety and history management.
