# Git

## Description
Git is a distributed version control system that allows teams to manage and track changes to source code.

## Purpose and Benefits
- Enables efficient and decentralized collaboration among developers working on the same code.
- Provides a complete history of changes, allowing for easy identification and resolution of issues.
- Supports branching and merging, making it easier to work on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously.

## Key Features and Functionalities
- Version Control: Git tracks changes to files and provides a complete history of commits made by different users.
- Branching and Merging: Git supports creating branches to work on new features or bug fixes and merging them back to the main branch.
- Collaboration and Code Review: Git enables developers to collaborate and review code by creating pull requests and leaving comments.

## Use Cases and Examples
- Team Collaboration: Git allows developers to collaborate on projects, work on separate branches, and resolve conflicts.
- Code Review: Git's pull request feature facilitates code review, enabling teams to ensure code quality before merging changes.
- Version Control: Git manages the history of changes made to a codebase, allowing easy rollbacks and finding the root cause of issues.
