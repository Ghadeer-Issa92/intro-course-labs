# DevOps Technical Practices

DevOps is a various technical practices that are essential for delivering high-quality software quickly. some of these technical practices are:

## 1. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
Continuous Integration (CI) involves adding new feature from different teams to the main product. Continuous Deployment (CD) is the practice of delivering the product without manual intervention. This practice helps to add new features and deliver the software faster and without errors.

**Example:** Jenkins, a tool that is often used for implementing CI/CD. It automates the process from building to testing then deploying the code.


## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
IaC is the practice of managing computing infrastructure with configuration code, rather than physical hardware configuration.

**Example:** AWS CloudFormation allow teams to define their infrastructure as code. This makes it easier to manage, replicate, and version control infrastructure.

## 3 Monitoring and Logging
Monitoring and logging involve tracking changes, reporting errors, and keeping a log of events or changes.

**Example:**Datadog provide real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities, allowing teams to quickly identify and address issues.

## 4. Automated Testing
Automated testing is a very important DevOps practice, which involves using tools to automatically execute tests. This would speed up the testing process.

**Example:** Jest can be used to automate testing of web applications. This allows teams to quickly identify and fix issues.



## 5. Shared Tools and Toolchains
 collections of tools that help in accomplishing tasks based on the team's preferences. These toolchains should be standardized and made available to everyone so teams donâ€™t have to start from scratch.

**Example:** Tools like Git for version control, Docker for containerization.
