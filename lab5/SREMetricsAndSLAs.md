## Key Metrics in Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)

**Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)** is a discipline that uses software engineering principles to solve operational problems and aims to create highly reliable software systems. The key metrics used in SRE are often referred to as the **"Four Golden Signals"**. These are:

- **Latency:** This is the time it takes for a system to respond to a request. Monitoring latency helps SRE teams identify services that are not performing well and detect incidents faster.

- **Traffic:** This measures the number of concurrent users or requests that a service is handling. It helps teams plan and allocate resources effectively.

- **Errors:** These are the rate of failed requests. Errors could be due to the system being down, or a bug in the code. Monitoring this rate helps teams identify and fix issues quickly.

- **Saturation:** This is the measure of the system's utilization. When the system is nearing its capacity, performance often degrades. Monitoring saturation helps teams plan for scaling and avoid performance issues.

**In addition to the Four Golden Signals, SREs also use three important metrics to monitor and measure the performance and reliability of IT systems:**

- **Service-Level Indicators (SLIs):** These are the actual measurements of the metric an SLO defines. They quantify measurements of service level provided to the user.

- **Service-Level Objectives (SLOs):** These are specific and quantifiable goals that the software should achieve at a reasonable cost.

- **Service-Level Agreements (SLAs):** These are the contractual agreements that state what would happen when one or more SLOs are not met.

**Service Level Agreements (SLAs)** are essential tools for setting performance expectations between a service provider and a customer, as more organizations rely on external providers for their critical systems, applications, and data. They ensure that cloud providers meet certain enterprise-level requirements and provide customers with a clearly defined set of deliverables. It also describes financial penalties, such as credits for service time, if the provider fails to live up to the guaranteed terms.
