# Git

## Description
Git is a distributed version control system that allows teams to manage and track changes to source code.

## Purpose and Benefits
- Enables efficient and decentralized collaboration among developers working on the same code.
- Provides a complete history of changes, allowing for easy identification and resolution of issues.
- Supports branching and merging, making it easier to work on multiple features or bug fixes simultaneously.

## Key Features and Functionalities
- Version Control: Git tracks changes to files and provides a complete history of commits made by different users.
- Branching and Merging: Git supports creating branches to work on new features or bug fixes and merging them back to the main branch.
- Collaboration and Code Review: Git enables developers to collaborate and review code by creating pull requests and leaving comments.

## Use Cases 
Our robotic team works on different projects and we use Git repositories to manage our codebase, dependencies, and configurations for each robot project. This allows us to maintain different versions of our software and switch between them easily. also help us to share our code and track changes, which enables us to identify and resolve conflicts quickly, ensuring that the codebase remains stable and up-to-date.
