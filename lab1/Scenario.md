# DevOps Application Scenario


Let's assume that we work for a robotics company that's specialized in designing and developing industrial robots.
the company has started encountering several challenges:

1. **Inconsistent Environments:** The development and manufacturing environments tend to have minor inconsistencies, causing some functional errors in the robots. for example a code that runs fine in the development environment may exhibit unexpected behavior when we use it with the actual robot.

2. **Limited Replicability:** Developers struggle to replicate errors reported from the manufacturing or robot environments, which slows down the troubleshooting process.

3. **Poor Collaboration:** The development team faces challenges when integrating different parts of the system, resulting in unnecessary project delays.


The following DevOps principles could potentially increase the company's productivity:

## 1. Containerization with Docker

By containerizing their ROS applications with Docker, they can create a consistent environment across development, testing, and manufacturing stages. Docker containers provide isolation, ensuring that the application runs the same, regardless of the infrastructure. This consistency reduces functional errors in the latest stages.

## 2. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Using IaC tools, they can codify their infrastructure setup, ensuring an exact replicated environment can be setup for troubleshooting purposes with fast and ease.

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline

Creating a CI/CD pipeline will automate building, testing, and deployment processes. It helps to validate every change made in the Git repository making the integration process smooth and error diffusion level close, ensuring quick correction.
